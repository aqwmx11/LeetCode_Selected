I really think too much of this question.
My original thought is to catch all the non-decreasing sequences in the whole sequence.
While this is true, I then think of trying to catch the beginning point and end point of each sequence.
However, just as the discussion mentioned, we do not need to know these points.
We are like "integrating" all the non-decreasing sequences, so we just add them up.
For the decreasing sequences, we just treat them as zeroes (which contributes nothing to our integration).
