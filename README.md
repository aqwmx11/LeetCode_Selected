# LeetCode_Selected
Hi, I just followed one of my senior's idea to practice programming on LeetCode. I am going to upload some interesting or difficult question on GitHub to track my progression. I will mostly code in C++ or Python, and I am now more focused on the algorithm part. I will add more content about data structure and mySQL in the future.
I will upload my answer together with a txt file which records what I learned after finishing the question. The code file is named directly by the question ID on leetcode, so you can simply find the original question.
Let's practice programming:) Any suggestions are appreciated.
