In this question, if you try to use nums to decide result matrix,that is try to find result[i][j]=f(nums), you will be screwd. The effective way will be to find nums[i][j]=g(result). 
Also, note that there are differences between vector of vector of ints and two dimensional arrays. vector<vector<int>> do check whether you reach beyond the index while two dimensional arrays not, so you cannot loop through a vector<vector<int>> like nums[0][i] as you can in the 2D arrays. nums.begin()+i are also not allowed once it enters to nums[1]. I have to double check to see how I can implement loop through nums[i][[j1] and nums[i+1][j2].
